I am just writng some gibberish here. I love Sidharth and Aditi.
They mean everythin to me. I want to achieve something in life
before I die.

I want to achieve greatness and then die. There
is not other purpose in life.

Manually commiting changes is far more logical.

Committing multiple files is good for software projects.
